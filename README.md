# DDLC - MC Revenge Mod
What if the main character of Doki-Doki Literature Club becomes sentient and self-aware, similar to Monika? He was awaken by the power of my coding and begin to realise that this is all just a game? What will he do? You will find out soon enough if play this mod!

## Releases
[First Demo Release v0.1.1](https://github.com/firelightning13/DDLC-MCRevengeMod/releases/tag/v0.1-demo)

This version contains:
- Story taken from Act 2
- **Fix grammar mistakes** (thanks to @DimasDSF )
- Temporary intro scene
- Day one scene
- Secrets (idk how many secrets in this mod actually cus I never count them)
- Just Monika

## About this project
Note: This mod is a fan work, and currently under my development. This mod is clearly inspired from original Doki-Doki Literature Club and I gave it a little bit of twist, giving much more options and flexibilities to player, but still limited to what Ren.py engine offers, and my limited abilities and understandings to mod itself. Also, you still can consider this an "alternate universe of DDLC".

## Plot (might be spoiler)
- Prologue = Post-Sayori hanging event and before Act 2. Also MC will realise that Monika is the culprit of that major event.
- Day one = MC's being self-aware to glitches and bugs in the game.
- Day two = MC will likely to negotiate Yuri and Natsuki with their argument.
- Day three = MC will acquire sentient power, just like Monika **(temporary idea)**
- Day four = MC will have a big revealation or (epiphany) from Third Eye **(temporary idea)**
- Weekend = Another major event from Yuri. There are little chance that you will save her for killing herself. **(temporary idea)**
- Ending = Likely will have two ending. Either you will side with Monika, or kill her. (by deleting her .chr file) **(temporary idea)**
