# DDLC - MC Revenge Mod
What if the main character of Doki-Doki Literature Club became sentient and self-aware, similar to Monika? He was awaken by the power of my coding and begin to realise that this is all just a game? What will he do? You will find out soon enough if you install this mod! (Which is not release yet, sorry!)

## Releases
It's to early to release. Coming soon for chapter one (Act 2)

## About this project
This mod is still under my development. And my avenge to Sayori. Sayori is the best girl.

This mod is similar to Act 2, Chapter 1 of the original DDLC story, but this takes a whole(not really) new direction of the story. You will understand once you play this mod!

## Want to help me?
You can modify if you want to help me. Just use pull request, and I will approve.
