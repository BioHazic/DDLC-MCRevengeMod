# DDLC - MC Revenge Mod
What if the main character of Doki-Doki Literature Club becomes sentient and self-aware, similar to Monika? He was awaken by the power of my coding and begin to realise that this is all just a game? What will he do? You will find out soon enough if play this mod!

## About this project
This mod is still under my development. And my avenge to Sayori. Sayori is the best girl.

This mod is similar to Act 2, Chapter 1 of the original DDLC story, but this takes a whole(not really) new direction of the story. And weird twist of conversation. And plot twist maybe idk. You will understand once you play this mod!

## Plot (might be spoiler)
- Prologue = Post-Sayori hanging event and before Act 2. Also MC will realise that Monika is the culprit of that major event.
- Day one = MC's being self-aware to glitches and bugs in the game.
- Day two = MC will likely to negotiate Yuri and Natsuki with their argument.
- Day three = MC will acquire sentient power, just like Monika (early plan)
- Day four = MC will have a big revealation or (epiphany) from Third Eye (early plan)
- Weekend = Another major event from Yuri. There are little chance that you will save her for killing herself. (early plan)
- Ending = Likely will have two ending. Either you will side with Monika, or kill her. (by deleting her .chr file) (early plan)
