# DDLC - MC Revenge Mod
What if the main character of Doki-Doki Literature Club becomes sentient and self-aware, similar to Monika? He was awaken by the power of my coding and begin to realise that this is all just a game? What will he do? You will find out soon enough if play this mod!

## Releases

- Temporary intro scene
- Day one scene
- Secrets (idk how many secrets in this mod actually cus I never count them)

## About this project
Note: This mod is a fan work, and currently under my development. This mod is clearly inspired from original Doki-Doki Literature Club and I gave it a little bit of twist, giving much more options and flexibilities to player, but still limited to what Ren.py engine offers, and my limited abilities and understandings to mod itself. Also, you still can consider this an "alternate universe of DDLC".

## My plan on making story (warning: spoiler!)
